# OpenCV Build Script
With this simple bash script, you will *not* need anymore to compile your OpenCV code with the aux of CMakeList e Makefile,<br>
avoiding the stress of compiling copy-pasted code everytime into your config file.

Simple as it is, bebfore using this script is *strongly* suggested to create an alias to make the script executable everywhere<br>
into your system.Instead, is requested the presence of the OpenCV build dir into the path variables.<br>

If you *don't have* the OpenCV_DIR set into your shell file, you should do something like this (example for *bash shell*, <br>
assuming you have installed OpenCV and it is currently into your main folder): <br>

```console
foo@bar:~$ echo 'export OpenCV_DIR=~/OpenCV/build' >> .bashrc<br>
```

Once done that, create an hidden folder to contain the OpenCV build file: <br>

```console
foo@bar:~$ mkdir .buildOpenCV <br>
```
